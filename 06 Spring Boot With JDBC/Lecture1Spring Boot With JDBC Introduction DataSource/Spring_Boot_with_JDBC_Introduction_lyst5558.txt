=> Spring Boot JDBC Module :-
	-> Spring Boot with JDBC provides a streamlined way to connect the spring boot applications with JDBC and execute the SQL queries
	-> For Spring Boot JDBC applications, we have to include one dependency i.e. "spring-boot-starter-jdbc"
	-> Some important interfaces and classes provides by "spring-boot-starter-jdbc" are :-
		1. DataSource <interface>
		2. JdbcTemplate <class>
		3. NamedParameterJdbcTemplate <class>
		   etc
	
	-> NOTE :-
		= Spring Boot JDBC Module builds upon Spring JDBC Module
		= Spring Boot auto-configures the DataSource, JdbcTemplate and NamedParameterJdbcTemplate beans, reducing manual configurations
		
-------------------------------------------------

=> DataSource :-
	-> DataSource is an interface which is present in "javax.sql" package
	-> It provides connections to the database and manages connection pooling
	-> In Spring Boot, DataSource is auto-configured by default based on the application's properties
	-> DataSource configuration properties can be customized in application.properties or application.yml file
