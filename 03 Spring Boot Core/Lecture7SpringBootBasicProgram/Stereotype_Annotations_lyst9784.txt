=> Stereotype Annotations :-
	-> Stereotype annotations are used to indicate the roles of classes in the application
	-> They offer default behaviour and simplify dependency injection for specific roles
	-> Spring boot automatically detects and manages classes annotated with stereotypes during auto-configurations
	-> Stereotype annotations improve code readability and maintability
	-> Most commonly used stereotype annotations are :-
		1. @Component
			= It is generic annotation for any Spring bean managed by the container
		2. @Service
			= It marks tghe class that implements business logic and exposes services
		3. @Repository
			= It identifies a class for data access functionality i.e. interacting with database
		4. @Controller
			= It denotes a class responsible for handling web requests and responding with views
		5. @RestController
			= It is similar to @Controller but specializes in returning data in JSON or other formats
		   etc
