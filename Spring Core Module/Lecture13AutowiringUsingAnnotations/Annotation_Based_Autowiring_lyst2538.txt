=> Java + Annotation Based Autowiring :-
	-> In this case we have to use @Autowired annotation
	-> @Autowired annotation can be used with field (property), setter method or constructor
	
	-> If there are 2 bean objects which are ready to be injected in the bean then there will be confusion. To remove this confusion we can use one annotation i.e. @Qualifier
	
	-> Note : We can use @Autowired annotation in case of XML spring configuration file
