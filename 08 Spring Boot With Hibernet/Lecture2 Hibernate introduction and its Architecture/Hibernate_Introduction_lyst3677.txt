=> Hibernate :-
	-> Hibernate is an open-source ORM tool or framework for java
	-> NOTE : Hibernate is not a core or official component of Java EE (Java Enterprise Edition) platform
	-> Hibernate was developed by Gavin King while working in JBoss. The project was later acquired by RedHat company
	-> Hibernate first version was released in 2001
	
	-> It simplifies database programmign in java applications by mapping java objects to database tables, making it easier to work with relational database
	
	-> Features of Hibernate :-
		1. Database Independent:
			= It supports various relational database
		2. Automatic Table Generation:
			= It generates database schema from java classes
		3. Query Language :-
			= Hibernate provides its own query language i.e. HQL (Hibernate Query Language). It is database-independent which allows us to write queries using a syntax that hibernate translates into database-specific SQL queries
		4. Caching:
			= It provides very good cache mechanism for better performance
		5. Transaction Management:
			= It supports ACID transaction properties
		6. Connection Pooling:
			= It manages and optimizes the database connections
		7. Integration:
			= It can be easily integrated with Java EE applications and Java Frameworks (Spring, Spring Boot etc)
		8. Community Support:
			= It provides active open-source community for updates and supports
		etc
		
	-> Hibernate Architecture :-
		= Diagram
		
	-> Components of Hibernate Architecture :-
		1. Application Layer:
			= In this layer persistence object is created
			= In this layer we provide business logic and persistence operations
			= In this layer hibernate software will be activated
		2. Persistence Object:
			= It is java object that represents the data and is designed to be persistent (means it can be stored or retrieve or modify the data from relational database)
		3. Hibernate Configuration File:
			= It is typically XML or Java file
			= It contains settings and properties for hibernate i.e. database connection information, dialects, cache settings etc
		4. Hibernate Mapping File:
			= A hibernate mapping file (usually in XML format) defines how java objects are to be mapped with database tables
		5. Hibernate Software:
			= When the client activates hibernate, the framework retrieves the configuration details from hibernate configuration file and establish the database connection
			= When the client initiates persistence operation, hibernate generates the appropriate database-specific SQL query and executes it
		6. Relational Database:
			= The persistence object will be mapped with relational database and new table with data will be created
