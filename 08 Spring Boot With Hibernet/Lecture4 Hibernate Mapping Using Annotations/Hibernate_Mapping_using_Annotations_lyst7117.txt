=> Annotations used for hibernate mapping are :-
	1. @Entity
	2. @Table
	3. @Id
	4. @Column
	
--------------------------------

=> @Entity :-
	-> The @Entity annotation is used to mark the java class as an entity, indicating that instances of this class will be mapped to rows in a database table
	-> When we annotate a class with @Entity, hibernate recognizes it as a persistence entity and we can perform database operations (eg. insert, update, delete etc) on instances of this class
	-> This annotation is used at the class level
	-> Syntax :-
		@Entity
		class ClassName
		{
			//class members
		}
		
		
=> @Table :-
	-> @Table annotation is used to map the class with database table
	-> This annotation is used at the class level
	-> Syntax :-
		@Entity
		@Table(name = "table_name")
		class ClassName
		{
			//class members
		}
		
		
=> @Id :-
	-> @Id annotation is used to specify the primary key of an entity class. It marks a field as the unique identifier for instances of that entity
	-> This annotation is used with field (attribute) within the entity class
	-> Syntax :-
		@Entity
		@Table(name = "table_name")
		class ClassName
		{
			@Id
			private int stdid;
		}
		
		
=> @Column :-
	-> @Column is used to map the field with table column
	-> It is used with fields (attributes) within the entity class
	-> Syntax :-
		@Entity
		@Table(name = "table_name")
		class ClassName
		{
			@Id
			@Column(name = "column_name")
			private int stdid;
		}
