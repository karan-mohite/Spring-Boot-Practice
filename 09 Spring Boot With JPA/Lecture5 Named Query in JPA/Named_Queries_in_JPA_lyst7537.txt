=> Named Queries in JPA :-
	-> Named queries in JPA are queries to which we assign a particular name, making them easier to reference and reuse throughout our application
	-> We can declare named queries in an entity class or in xml file
	-> Syntax :-
		= In an entity file:
			@NamedQuery(name="--queryName--" query="----JPQL----")
			class Student
			{
				//body
			}
			
		= In XML file (orm.xml)
			<named-query name="--queryName--">
				<query> ----JPQL---- </query>
			</named-query>
			
	-> NOTE :-
		= Named queries in JPA are used for selecting data (SELECT query). These are not used for inserting, updating and deleting data (INSERT, UPDATE & DELET queries)
		
	-> Advantages of Named Queries :-
		1. Code Reusability:
			= Named Queries can be reused in different parts of our application, reducing the code duplication. This enhances the consistency and readability of the code
		2. Code Maintability:
			= Named Queries centralize query definations, making it easier to maintain and update queries across our application. When a query needs modification, we can update it in one place and all the reference to that query will autoamtically updated
		3. Type Safety:
			= Named Queries are checked for correctness at compile time, which helps to catch the errors early in the development process
		etc
