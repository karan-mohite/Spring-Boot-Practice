=> There are 2 key concepts in Spring Boot :-
	1. Microservices
	2. Microservices Architecture
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Microservices :-
	-> Microservices refers to small, independent services that each handle a specific piece of business functionality within an application.
	
	-> Characteristics of Microservices:
		= Microservices are developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
		= Microservices are building blocks of microservices architecture.
		= Microservices are developed using RESTful Web Services or APIs.
	
	-> Advantages of Microservices:
		1. Focused Teams
			= Teams can concentrate on a specific functionality, leading to better code quality and expertise.
		2. Better Resource Utilization
			= Services can be deployed on different servers or containers, optimizing resource usage.
		3. Simplified Testing
			= Smaller services are easier to test in isolation.
		4. Enhanced Security:
			= Microservices can be isolated in terms of security, reducing the impact of a breach.
		5. Technology-Neutral
			= Microservices can be developed within different technologies, best suited for the task.
