=> JavaScript :-
	-> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used primarily for creating interactive web pages and applications.
	-> It supports both client-side scripting for web development using HTML and CSS, and server-side scripting for backend development using Node.js.
	
	-> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. Initially named "LiveScript", it was renamed to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time.
	
	-> Features of JavaScript:
		1. JavaScript is a lightweight and interpreted language.
		2. Almost all browsers support JavaScript.
		3. JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
		4. JavaScript follows the syntax and structure similar to C programming language, making it a structured programming language.
		5. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language where objects inherit properties and methods directly from other objects rather than from classes.
		
	-> Use of JavaScript:
		1. Web Development:
			= Creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
		2. Web Applications:
			= Developing complex web applications, including single-page applications (SPAs).
		3. Server-Side Applications:
			= Using Node.js to build scalable network applications.
		4. Mobile Applications:
			= Using frameworks like React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications.
		5. Game Development:
			= Creating browser-based games.
		6. Desktop Applications:
			= Developing desktop applications using frameworks like Electron.
	-> NOTE :-
		= At present we will use javascript only client-side scripting:
			>> Pop-up Windows
			>> Animations
				- Animation sliders
				- Zoom effects
				- Animated galleries
			>> Form Validations
			>> Charts and Graphs
			>> Calendar and Date/Time Pickers
			>> Drop-down Menus
			>> Maps
			
	-> Types Of JavaScript :
		1. Internal JavaScript
			= It is used inside the HTML <head> or <body> for embedding scripts.
			= Syntax:
				<script>
					javascript_code
				</script>
		2. External JavaScript
			= It is written in separate .js files and linked to the HTML file.
			= Syntax:
				<script src="path"></script>
			= It separates HTML and JS code to increase readability and maintainability.
			
	-> Variables in JavaScript :
		1. var
		2. let
		3. const
	-> How to write variable name ?
		= Correct ways ---- rollno, roll_no, roll-no, rollNo, rollno1
		= Wrong way ---- roll no, 1rollno, roll+no

	-> Data Types in JavaScript :
		1. var a=10; - number
		2. var a=12.5; - number
		3. var a=true; - boolean
		4. var a="hello"; - string
		5. var a='hello' - string
		6. var a=["deepak", "amit", "rahul"] - object
		7. var a={name : "deepak", rollno : 101}; - object
		8. var a=null; - object
		9. var a; - undefined

	-> JavaScript Operators : 
		1. Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%)
		2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
		3. Comparison Operators (==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
		4. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
		5. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
		6. Type Operators (typeOf, instanceOf)

	-> JavaScript Control Statements : 
		1. Selection Statements - if, if-else, if-else if, nested if, switch
		2. Looping Statements - for, while, do-while, for-in
		3. Break Statement - break, continue, return

	-> JavaScript provides different categories of objects and APIs to interact with both the structure of web pages and the web browser environment:
		1. DOM (Document Object Model):
			= It focuses on the document content and structure to manipulate the web page.
			= Examples of DOM objects: document, element, attribute etc.
		2. BOM (Browser Object Model):
			= It focuses on the browser window and functionalities to interact with the browser environment.
			= Examples of BOM objects: window, console, history, location etc.
	
--------------------------------------------

1. "document":
	= It is an object that represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
	= It provides properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the content, structure, and style of the document.
	= Methods of document object are:
		- write()
		- getElementById(id)
		- getElementsByClassName(className)
		- createElement(tagName)
		- getAttribute(name)
		- setAttribute(name, value)
		- querySelector(selector)
		- querySelectorAll(selector)
		etc
	= Properties of document object are:
		- innerHTML
		- innerText
		etc
		
2. "window":
	= It is an object that represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
	= It provides properties and methods for interacting with the browser environment.
	= Methods of window object are:
		- alert(message)
		- confirm(message)
		- prompt(message, defaultText)
		- open(url, target, features)
		- setInterval(function, milliseconds)
		- clearInterval(intervalId)
		etc
	= Properties of window object are:
		- innerHeight
		- innerWidth
		- outerHeight
		- outerWidth
		- location
		etc
