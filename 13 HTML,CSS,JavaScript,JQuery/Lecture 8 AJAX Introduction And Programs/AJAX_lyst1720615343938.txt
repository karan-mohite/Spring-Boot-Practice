=> AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):
	-> AJAX is a technique or set of technologies used to create dynamic web pages.
	-> It allows developers to update webpages, request/receive data from servers and send data in the background without reloading the web page.
	
	-> AJAX is widely used in web development to enhance the user experience by allowing web pages to be updated asynchronously. Below are some common applications of AJAX:
		1. Updating webpages without reloading:
			= AJAX updates parts of a webpage without reloading the entire page (e.g. liking a post, updating a shopping cart).
		2. Auto-complete suggestions:
			= AJAX provides real-time suggestions in search bars (e.g. Google search suggestions, product recommendations).
		3. Infinite scrolling:
			= AJAX implements infinite scrolling, loading more content as users scroll down (e.g. social media feeds).
		4. Form validation and submission:
			= AJAX validates forms on the client-side before submission, improving user experience (e.g. checking email format).
		5. Live content updates:
			= AJAX updates content in real-time (e.g. chat messages, stock tickers, live sports scores).
		etc
	
	-> NOTE:
		= AJAX is not a programming language.
		= Besides XML, AJAX can transport data in plain text, JSON, HTML etc.
		
	-> AJAX key technologies are:
		1. XMLHttpRequest:
			= It is a built-in browser object used to exchange data with the server without reloading the web page.
		2. JavaScript(or jQuery) and HTML DOM:
			= These are used to display or manipulate the data received.

	-> Methods:
		1. open(method, url, async, username, password): Initializes the request.
			= method: HTTP method (e.g., "GET", "POST").
			= url: The URL of the resource to fetch.
			= async (optional): Boolean indicating asynchronous (true) or synchronous (false) request. Defaults to true (asynchronous).
			= username (optional): Username for authentication (if needed).
			= password (optional): Password for authentication (if needed).
		2. send(data): Sends the request to the server. Optional data argument for sending data with the request (e.g., for POST requests).
		3. abort(): Cancels the current request.
		4. setRequestHeader(name, value): Sets a request header for the request.
		5. getAllResponseHeaders(): Returns all response headers as a string.
		6. getResponseHeader(name): Returns a specific response header by name.

	-> Properties:
		1. readyState: Indicates the state of the request (0-4):
			= 0: Unsent
			= 1: Opened
			= 2: Headers Received
			= 3: Loading
			= 4: Done
		2. status: HTTP status code of the response (once the request is complete).
		3. statusText: Text description of the HTTP status code.
		4. responseText: Response data as a string (useful for plain text or JSON).
		5. responseXML: Response data as an XML document (if applicable).

	-> Event Types:
		1. readystatechange: Triggered whenever the readyState property changes.
		2. load: Triggered when the request completes successfully (when readyState is 4 and status is 200).
		3, error: Triggered if the request encounters an error.
		4. abort: Triggered when the request is aborted.
		5. loadstart: Triggered when the request starts.
		6. loadend: Triggered when the request has completed, regardless of success or failure.
		7. progress: Triggered periodically during the request, as data is received.
		8. timeout: Triggered if the request times out.
