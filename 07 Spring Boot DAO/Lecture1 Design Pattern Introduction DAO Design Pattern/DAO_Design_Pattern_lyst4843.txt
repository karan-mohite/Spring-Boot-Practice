=> Design Pattern :-
	-> Design patterns are established best practices and reusable templates for solving common software design problem
		= "established best practices" means that these practices have been tried, tested and widely recognized as effective solutions
	-> They offer structured approaches to create relationship and interacts between classes and objects, promoting efficient, maintanable and scalable code
	-> For eg.
		= Singleton Design Pattern
		= Factory Design Pattern
		= Abstract Factory Design Pattern
		= Prototype Design Pattern
		= DAO Design Pattern
		= MVC Design Pattern
		= Dependency Injection Design Pattern
		  etc
		  
	-> NOTE : There is one book for design patterns i.e. "Design Patterns : Elements or Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

=> DAO Design Pattern :-
	-> DAO stands for "Data Access Object"
	-> Diagram
	-> It is used to separate the data persistence logic into a separate layer. This way, any other layer i.e. service layer etc does not know how low-level operations are performed to access the database
	
	-> How to achieve DAO Design Pattern :-
		1. Create separate DAO package
		2. Create an interface which contains abstract methods
		3. Create an implemented class and override/implement the methods
