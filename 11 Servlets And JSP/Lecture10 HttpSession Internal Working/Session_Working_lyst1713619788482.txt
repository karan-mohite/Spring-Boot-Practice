=> Internal working of Session Management :-
	-> When we achieve Session Management using HttpSession, internally cookies (Session Tracking Mechanism) are used
	-> But there is one disadvantage of cookies i.e. client can disable the cookies in browser
	
	-> In case of session management, we container creates one session id i.e. JSESSIONID. This JSESSIONID is transfered from client to server in request header body. This JSESSIONID is matched by web container and it get to know that the client is new or old
